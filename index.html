          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Elephants are mammals of the family Elephantidae and the largest
            existing land animals. Three species are currently recognised: the
            African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian
            elephant. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order
            Proboscidea; extinct members include the mastodons. The family
            Elephantidae also contains several now-extinct groups, including the
            mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. African elephants have
            larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller
            ears, and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all
            elephants include a long trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive
            legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk, also called a
            proboscis, is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the
            mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the
            incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects
            and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant
            body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like legs
            carry their great weight.

          <h2>Habitat</h2>
          <p>
            Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,
            and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including
            savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and
            they stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to
            be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments.
            Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants; the
            exception is their predators such as lions, tigers, hyenas, and wild
            dogs, which usually target only young elephants (calves).

            Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and
            may live alone or with other males. Elephants can live up to 70
            years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and
            sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long
            distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of
            primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness, and
            appear to show empathy for dying and dead family members.

          <h2>Ecology and activities</h2>
          <p>
            The African bush elephant can be found in habitats as diverse as dry
            savannahs, deserts, marshes, and lake shores, and in elevations from
            sea level to mountain areas above the snow line. Forest elephants
            mainly live in equatorial forests but will enter gallery forests and
            ecotones between forests and savannahs.Asian elephants prefer areas
            with a mix of grasses, low woody plants, and trees, primarily
            inhabiting dry thorn-scrub forests in southern India and Sri Lanka
            and evergreen forests in Malaya.Elephants are herbivorous and will
            eat leaves, twigs, fruit, bark, grass and roots. They are born with
            sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's
            feces to digest vegetation. African elephants are mostly browsers
            while Asian elephants are mainly grazers. They can consume as much
            as 150 kg (330 lb) of food and 40 L (11 US gal) of water in a day.
            Elephants tend to stay near water sources. Major feeding bouts take
            place in the morning, afternoon and night. At midday, elephants rest
            under trees and may doze off while standing. Sleeping occurs at
            night while the animal is lying down. Elephants average 3–4 hours of
            sleep per day. Both males and family groups typically move 10–20 km
            (6–12 mi) a day, but distances as far as 90–180 km (56–112 mi) have
            been recorded in the Etosha region of Namibia. Elephants go on
            seasonal migrations in search of food, water, minerals, and mates.
            At Chobe National Park, Botswana, herds travel 325 km (202 mi) to
            visit the river when the local waterholes dry up.

            African elephants are listed as vulnerable and Asian elephants as
            endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
            (IUCN). One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the
            ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other
            threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts
            with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In
            the past, they were used in war; today, they are often
            controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for
            entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and
            have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and
            popular culture.
